** RADIOREC 0.1 Beta - REAME file **

Radiorec it's a simple program to play and record audio streams


WEBSITE: http://radio-rec.sourceforget.net


DEPENDENCIES (you should have these packages installed on your system):

    * Pygtk (>=2.0)
    * Pygst (>=0.10)


HOW TO RUN:

    Just execute radiorec at source root tree:

    ./radiorec

    NOTE: Not all stream servers send information about their music.
          In this case, titles, time duration, genres, etc, will not
          be avaliable. But you can keep record streams, Radiorec will
          use "untitled" as title and "unknown" as the others.
          Beaware just if you record two consecutive streams that not
          send information, because output file name could be the same,
          overwriting record files. 


ACKNOWLEDGES: To Tango Icon Library team, because I use their icons to
              produce Radiorec icon (I'm not a drawer, sorry).
